# Hostage Timeline Visualization

A comprehensive interactive timeline visualization showing the journey of every hostage from the October 7th incident through their current status, using a swimlane-based approach with smooth transitions.

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This visualization implements the complete specification from the PRD to show:
- **Military vs Negotiation Impact**: Visual comparison of hostage outcomes by release method
- **Event-Order Sorting**: Hostages with earlier transitions appear higher in lanes
- **RTL Hebrew Support**: Full right-to-left timeline with Hebrew labels and dates
- **Advanced Transitions**: 4px turn radius with parallel turning for simultaneous events
- **Interactive Features**: Tooltips with Hebrew content, hover effects, line highlighting

## 🚀 **Features Implemented**

### ✅ **Phase 1: Data Foundation**
- Complete CSV parsing with robust error handling
- Date validation and normalization (handles ranges and multiple formats)
- Event chronology calculation for proper sorting
- Data quality reporting and validation

### ✅ **Phase 2: Core Visualization Engine** 
- SVG-based RTL timeline with responsive design
- Dynamic lane height calculation based on content
- Hebrew date formatting with proper RTL text support
- Event-order sorting (never alphabetical) within lanes

### ✅ **Phase 3: State Transition System**
- Bezier curve transitions with 4px configurable turn radius
- Parallel turning for simultaneous transitions (no overlapping)
- Advanced path generation following PRD specifications
- Transition caching and optimization for performance

### ✅ **Phase 4: Interactive Features**
- Hebrew/English tooltips with comprehensive hostage information
- Smooth hover effects with line highlighting and dimming
- Responsive tooltip positioning
- Complete interaction state management

## 📊 **Data Requirements**

The visualization expects a CSV file with these columns:
- `Hebrew Name` - Primary identifier
- `Current Status` - Release/captivity status
- `Kidnapped Date`, `Release Date`, `Date of Death` - Key dates
- `Release/Death Circumstances` - Method classification
- `Age at Kidnapping`, `Photo URL` - Display information
- Additional metadata fields for comprehensive tooltips

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Modular Design**
```
js/
├── data-processor.js     # CSV parsing, validation, transformation
├── timeline-core.js      # SVG timeline, coordinate system, RTL layout
├── lane-manager.js       # Dynamic lane heights, event-order sorting
├── transition-engine.js  # Bezier curves, parallel turning mechanics
├── interaction.js        # Tooltips, hover effects, Hebrew translations
└── main.js              # Application coordination and lifecycle
```

### **Key Technical Features**
- **RTL-First Design**: Timeline flows right-to-left with proper Hebrew support
- **Dynamic Lane Heights**: Responsive sizing based on hostage count per lane
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles 240+ individual hostage lines smoothly
- **Error Resilient**: Graceful degradation with data quality issues

## 🎨 **Visual Design**

### **Lane Structure** (Top to Bottom)
1. **Released - Military (Living)** - Blue lines
2. **Released - Military (Deceased)** - Blue dashed lines  
3. **Released - Deals (Living)** - Green lines
4. **Released - Deals (Deceased)** - Green dashed lines
5. **Kidnapped (Living)** - Red lines
6. **Kidnapped (Deceased)** - Dark red dashed lines

### **Transition Mechanics**
- Lines remain horizontal until `event_date - turn_radius/2`
- Smooth Bezier curves during transition period
- Parallel turning prevents overlapping for simultaneous events
- Color evolution as hostages move between lanes

## 🚀 **Running the Visualization**

### **Quick Start**
```bash
cd hostage-timeline-viz
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080 in browser
```

### **Development Server**
```bash
# Any local server works
npx serve .
# or
php -S localhost:8080
```

## 📋 **Testing Checklist**

### **Visual Quality**
- [ ] All hostage lines visible and distinct
- [ ] No overlap between released and kidnapped sections  
- [ ] Compact spacing in lanes (no sparse appearance)
- [ ] Hebrew text displays correctly in RTL layout
- [ ] Smooth Bezier transitions at correct dates

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] Lines transition accurately on correct dates
- [ ] Event-order sorting shows earlier transitions higher
- [ ] Tooltips display comprehensive Hebrew information
- [ ] Hover effects highlight lines and dim others
- [ ] Responsive design works across screen sizes

### **Performance Criteria**
- [ ] Page loads within 3 seconds
- [ ] Smooth interactions under 100ms response time
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors
- [ ] Consistent positioning across page refreshes

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Customizable Parameters**
```javascript
// Turn radius for transitions
baseTurnRadius: 4  // pixels

// Lane spacing
lineSpacing: 4     // pixels between lines
lanePadding: 8     // internal lane padding

// Colors (customizable per lane type)
colors: {
  'kidnapped-living': '#ef4444',
  'released-military-living': '#3b82f6',
  'released-deal-living': '#22c55e'
  // ... etc
}
```

### **Data Source**
Update data source in `js/main.js`:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('data/hostages-from-kan.csv');
```

## 📈 **Future Enhancements**
