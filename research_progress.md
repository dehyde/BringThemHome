## Research Progress

### Phase 1: Initial Data Extraction ✅
- [x] Extract 240 entries from Kan.txt
- [x] Fix image URLs to full paths
- [x] Create backup file
- [x] Define categorization framework

### Phase 2: Research & Validation (In Progress)
| Status Category | Count | Researched | Validated | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Held in Gaza | 133 | 0 | 0 | Need current status verification |
| Deceased - Returned | 41 | 0 | 0 | Need return dates and circumstances |
| Unknown | 38 | 0 | 0 | Need status clarification |
| Deceased | 28 | 0 | 0 | Need death dates and circumstances |

### Research Notes & Issues
*(To be updated during research process)*

### Validated Sources Used
*(To be populated with specific article URLs)*

### Quality Control Checklist
- [ ] All dates follow standard format
- [ ] All citations are specific article URLs
- [ ] All circumstances use defined categories
- [ ] Cross-referenced multiple sources for verification
- [ ] Progress tracking updated regularly

## Next Steps
1. Start with "Deceased - Returned" cases (41 entries) - likely have most documentation
2. Research each case using existing article URLs as starting points
3. Validate and expand citation sources
4. Update progress tracker with each completed entry
